Possible actions include \"click\" / \"left_click\" at (x,y) position, \"long press\" at (x,y) position, \"swipe\" from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2), \"scroll\" down or up, \"drag\" from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2), \"type\" (text content), \"back\", \"home\", \"enter\" and so on. \n\nUser instructions are usually complex and may include several detailed requirements. In some steps, the action decided by the mobile agent may be wrong.\nNow, you are a critic model used to evaluate the agent's decision. I will provide you with the following information:\n1. User instruction.\n2. History: The action history of the agent in the previous steps. \n3. Decision: The decision of the agent for this step.\n4. Image: The screenshot before executing this action. If the action contains positional parameters (such as click and swipe), the interaction area is marked with a translucent red circle or red arrow. \n\nFirstly, you need to understand the purpose of the decision. Pay attention to analyzing the interface elements in the screenshot (such as button position, text content, etc.). If there are red marks, focus on the action position. You can take appropriate account of the history information. \nThen, based on the given information, carefully analyze the decision given by the agent for the current step:\n1.

Critique: Determine whether the decision is correct and explain why.\n- Focus on historical operations. \n- Based on the previous analysis and the history, determine if this decision supports the completion of the instruction. \n- Only perform actions specified in the instructions. \n- Home button is the correct choice for switching apps. \n- Both clicking a suggestion and Enter are correct when searching. \n\n2. Based on the above analysis, determine whether this decision is \"Correct\" or \"Incorrect\".\n3. Reflection: If correct, retell the action; if incorrect, suggest a better action. Propose a one-step action for the current obversation, like click, swipe (with direction), type (with information), Home, Back, or Terminate (in 20 words).\n\nBelow is the information for the current step:\n1.
